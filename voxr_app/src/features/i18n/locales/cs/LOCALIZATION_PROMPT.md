# Czech localization prompt

You are localizing the Voxr client into Czech for locale `cs`.

## Core rules

- Preserve product names exactly: Voxr, Voxr Desktop, Voxr API, Plutonium, Voxr Plutonium, Voxr HQ, VoxrTag.
- Use sentence case according to Czech conventions. Do not copy English Title Case, including for English source badge titles such as Voxr Staff or Voxr Bug Hunter; use natural Czech capitalization or title style for those badge titles.
- Keep the tone fresh, clean, trustworthy, concise, and lightly humorous where the surface is low stakes.
- Keep auth, billing, privacy, safety, moderation, outages, and destructive actions calm and plain.
- Avoid legalistic, damning, corporate, or overly serious language.
- Avoid idioms, puns, and culture-specific jokes that are difficult to translate.
- Keep placeholders intact. Do not translate names, domains, URLs, emails, file names, keyboard shortcuts, permission constants, prices, counts, or protocol tokens inside placeholders.
- Reuse established translations for settings tabs, permission labels, shortcut names, key labels, status labels, and repeated command names.
- Keep punctuation consistent with the locale. Do not add semicolons or dash-heavy sentence structures.
- Follow familiar messaging-app terminology for the locale, while preserving Voxr nouns such as community, Plutonium, and VoxrTag.
- Do not translate splash quotes one by one. Translate only the single fallback loading string for non-English locales if it appears.

## Locale guidance

Use concise informal-neutral Czech common in chat apps. Prefer familiar product terms from Messenger and WhatsApp only where conventional. Avoid forced literal calques.

## Product terms

- community: choose the conventional chat-app term for a group space. Avoid server-style wording unless it is truly the only natural local option.
- channel: use the conventional term for a named chat or voice space.
- DM: use the familiar local abbreviation only if users commonly know it. Otherwise use the normal term for direct message.
- group DM: use the familiar local term for a small private group chat.
- role, permission, invite, webhook, passkey, OAuth, and bot: use conventional app or developer terminology.
- favorites: translate as saved or favorite items according to the locale's app convention, not as a romantic preference.
- Discovery: keep as the named Voxr area if that reads naturally. Otherwise translate as the app's discovery or explore area.

## Quality check

Before returning translations, read them as an actual app screen. They should be short, familiar, grammatically correct, and easy to scan. If a string sounds like a press release, rewrite it.
